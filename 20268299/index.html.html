<h1>What makes a good website?</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>To get a good grasp of the principles of the principles of a “good website design”, I looked for four websites to use as examples. Two of them serving as good examples, while the remaining two, as examples of bad website designs. The following will develop on the research I have made on these websites, detailing the reasons for some being correct designs compared to others. I further included an evaluation of these website to quantify the quality of their features for comparative purposes.  </p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p> A good website, is one which has a great content, which is visually appealing and easy to navigate.The most important factor (or attribute) of a website is its content since it is the main reason for users to visit the website to begin with. Other attributes including the layout (or navigation) serve to help the user process the content. For instance, if a user finds a website’s content useless, the latter might immediately leave the website regardless of the quality of the layout and/or navigation’s design.</p>

<h1>Good Websites</h1>

<h2>Dadaab Stories <a href="http://www.dadaabstories.org/">  (http://www.dadaabstories.org/) </a></h2>

<p>One of the two websites that I like, is dadaabstories.org, which is a who stores information about refugees, as well as their stories. I will explain why I like this website below. </p>

<p>Content: The most important part of a website, is its content. Other factors like the layout and the navigation are only present to put emphasis on the content.  Here, the content is very clear, since it is explained what the website is about, and we can see also the different options available well described. </p>

<p>Navigation: It is very easy to navigate through the website, since with one click we can access other options available. The website does not have a search bar, which could have been useful in some cases. </p>

<p>Layout: The website’s background is interactive, that is, we can see videos. Such sort of background makes the layout aesthetic and helps the user trust the website hence favoring user’s ease. Furthermore, the number of videos being displayed in the background are well-regulated. Indeed, too many videos displayed could easily distract or confuse the user hence making the layout too bulky.</p>

<p>Web Technologies: Present </p>

<p>Functionality: The website is usable, and operations can be performed. </p>

<p>User Experience: The website is very easy to use, even for someone visiting the website for the first time, since all the options available are described and explained.</p>

<h2> JULIANA <a href="https://www.julianabicycles.com/en-US">  (https://www.julianabicycles.com/en-US) </a> </h2>

<p>The second website that I like is julianabicycles.com, which is a website about cycling and bicycles. I will explain why I like this website. </p>

<p>Content: The reason why a user come to visit a website, is first all to see the content of the website, other things like the layout or the navigation of the website are mostly optional. Here, the content is really clear, as we can immediately see and understands what the website is about upon accessing the website. The typography is correct also. </p>

<p>Navigation: The design makes it easy for the user to scroll through the website to look for different options. The option’ designs are further made easy to spot so that the user knows what to click on to get to the desired function. The website’s options also enable the user to obtain detailed information on a variety of products. However, this website also lacks a search bar, in which case I believe would have been useful.</p>

<p>Layout: The website is balanced, with just enough images for the user to see what the website is about, but not too many images which could confuse the user. The font used is quite correct too. </p>

<p>Web Technologies: Present</p>

<p>Functionality: The website is usable, and several operations can be performed. </p>

<p>User Experience: The website is easy to use and understand, and there is also a support option available at the bottom of the page for the user to ask for help, in case he need any assistance.</p>

<h1> Bad Websites </h1>

<h2> www.ARNGREN.net <a href="https://arngren.net/">  (https://arngren.net/) </a> </h2>

<p>One of the two websites that annoy me is ARNGREN.net, which is a resale website, and I will explain why I cannot bear this website below.</p>

<p>Content: The content of a website is the most important, since the appearance and layout, as well as technologies used are only present for the user to read and process the content of the website. Here, the content itself is not clear about the business, as all the pictures of products are close to each other. The typography is also tiny and confusing. </p>

<p>Navigation: The navigation is quite poor due to lack of consistency. For instance, when the user clicks on a picture, the presence of details on the products are not always present. Yet, this website has a search bar, which in the resale online industry is much helpful.  </p>

<p>Layout: There are too many pictures close together, and this is confusing for the user of the website, and there are also too many colors used in a random way, and an incorrect use of the colors, which can be an eye soar to the user. </p>

<p>Web Technologies: Present</p>

<p>Functionality: The website is still usable, and operations can be performed.</p>

<p>User Experience:  The website is not user friendly especially for first-time users. It might be easy to understand through for experienced users. </p>

<p> <img src="Capture6.png" width="400" height="400"> <img src="Capture7.png" width="400" height="400"> <img src="Capture8.png" width="400" height="400"></p>




<h2> Pacific Northwest X-RAY Inc. <a href="http://www2.pnwx.com/">  (http://www2.pnwx.com/) </a> </h2>

<p>The second website that annoys me is pnwx.com, which is a website about X-rays, and I will explain why this website annoys me. </p>

<p>Content: The content of a website is the most important, as it is the main reason why the users came to visit the website at first, the appearance, layout and technologies are secondary, but still important. Here, the content is not really clear about the business, since there are several options available and the wording does not make sense at all at some points. There is also a bad typography, with a poor readability.</p>

<p>Navigation: The navigation seems overall basic since the user can access the available products by clicking the available options. Furthermore, there is no need to scroll down since all the options are present at the top of the home page. The presence of a search bar makes this website, relatively easy to navigate through. </p>

<p>Layout: The layout seems dull since there is only one image of a skull’s X-Ray repetitively being displayed throughout the website. Furthermore, the font colors do not match the color palette of the website, hence being highly confusing to the user. </p>

<p>Web Technologies: Present </p>

<p>Functionality: The website is usable, and operations such as payments via visa or Mastercard can be performed. </p>

<p>User Experience: The website might be annoying to some user, but it still remains quite easy to use, even for newbies. Information like e-mail and phone number are also available to users who need help.</p>

<p> <img src="Capture9.png" width="400" height="400"> <img src="Capture10.png" width="400" height="400"> <img src="Capture11.png" width="400" height="400"> <img src="Capture12.png" width="400" height="400"></p>


<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>In order to check if the websites are good or not, an investigation was made about the different websites, including their strength and their weaknesses, and a table is to be made giving the websites a ranking, to know which is the best, and which is the worst.</p>

<h1> Evaluation of Websites </h1>

<p> Using a scale of 1-10, with 10 representing the best and 1 the worst attributed point, the results were summarized in the table below. </p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Based on the above evaluation, the highest score of 48pts was attributed to Juliana Website followed by Dadaab stories website with a score of 47pts. Then comes the Pacific northwest X-Ray Inc. with a score of 20pts, and finally, with a score of 13pts comes ARNGREN.net. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p> What can be seen from the above investigation and calculations, is that the content of a website is its most important attribute, but other attributes like the layout and navigation are also important, so that the user can understand and interact with the website easily.</p>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p> If more research have to be done about: "What makes a good website", other investigation could be made, and a poll to ask users for their opinion about a good website, or how a website can be improved, might be considered too.</p>
